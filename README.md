# C-Core_Design_Assistant

The goal of this project was to research the feasibility of using machine learning to develop a tool that could be given a target inductance for a C-Core device by a user, and output valid specifications for an equivalent circuit. This project showed that it is feasible, and a model was implemented using machine learning packages in Python. Two models were designed in the course of this project. The first trained a neural network using equivalent circuit parameters, and performed poorly with huge errors. The second model was trained using a single input inductance, from which a neural network determines a set of circuit parameters. These circuit parameters are then fed into a mathematical model, which generates an inductance value. The difference between the input inductance and the output inductance is the error metric by which the neural network is trained. This model achieved very low test errors around 1\%, and is a valid tool for producing ``device zero'' specifications during a design process.
